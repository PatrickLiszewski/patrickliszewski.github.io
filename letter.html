    <h2>Available Courses</h2>
    <p>Our art program offers a diverse range of courses, focusing on both traditional and modern artistic<br> techniques. Your enthusiasm for contemporary art techniques is particularly exciting. Here are the<br> courses that might interest you:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Modern Digital Art and Its Cultural Impact.</li>

    <h2>Artistic Inspirations</h2>
    <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my<br> favorite movements and their impact:</p>
    <p>Impressionism</p>
    <p class="movement">Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</p>
    
    <p>Abstract Expressionism</p>
    <p class="movement">This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.</p>
    
    <p>Pop Art</p>
    <p class="movement">A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</p>
